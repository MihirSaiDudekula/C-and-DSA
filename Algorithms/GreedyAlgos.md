Greedy algorithms are a class of algorithms that make locally optimal choices at each step with the hope that these local solutions will lead to a globally optimal solution. The main idea behind greedy algorithms is to build up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most immediate benefit.

### Key Characteristics of Greedy Algorithms
1. **Local Optimal Choice**: At each step, make a choice that looks best at the moment.
2. **Optimal Substructure**: A problem exhibits optimal substructure if an optimal solution to the problem contains optimal solutions to its subproblems.
3. **Greedy Choice Property**: A globally optimal solution can be arrived at by selecting a local optimum.

### Common Greedy Algorithm Examples
- **Activity Selection Problem**: Selecting the maximum number of activities that don't overlap.
- **Fractional Knapsack Problem**: Choosing items with the highest value-to-weight ratio first to maximize total value.
- **Huffman Coding**: Building a minimum-cost prefix code for data compression.
- **Prim's and Kruskal's Algorithms**: Finding a minimum spanning tree in a graph.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Finding the shortest path from a source to all vertices in a weighted graph.

### Identifying if a Problem Can Be Solved by a Greedy Approach
To determine if a problem can be solved using a greedy algorithm, you should check for the following properties:

1. **Greedy Choice Property**:
   - You should be able to make a choice that looks best at the moment and this choice should be part of the optimal solution.
   
2. **Optimal Substructure**:
   - An optimal solution to the problem contains an optimal solution to its subproblems. This means that you can break the problem into smaller subproblems, solve those optimally, and use those solutions to construct an optimal solution for the overall problem.

### Steps to Identify a Greedy Approach
1. **Formulate the Problem**: Clearly define the problem, the constraints, and the objective.
2. **Make a Greedy Choice**: Identify a choice that seems best at the moment. This choice should be simple and not require considering all possible solutions.
3. **Prove Greedy Choice Property**: Demonstrate that the locally optimal choice at each step leads to a globally optimal solution.
4. **Prove Optimal Substructure**: Show that the problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems which can be solved independently and optimally.
5. **Develop the Algorithm**: Write the algorithm based on the greedy choice and optimal substructure properties.

### Example: Fractional Knapsack Problem
**Problem**: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the maximum value that can be put in a knapsack of capacity W. You can take fractions of items.

**Steps**:
1. **Formulate the Problem**: Maximize the total value in the knapsack without exceeding the weight capacity.
2. **Make a Greedy Choice**: Select the item with the highest value-to-weight ratio first.
3. **Prove Greedy Choice Property**: Taking the item with the highest value-to-weight ratio first maximizes the value added per unit weight.
4. **Prove Optimal Substructure**: After choosing the item with the highest value-to-weight ratio, the remaining problem is to fill the remaining capacity in a similar manner.
5. **Develop the Algorithm**:
   - Sort items by value-to-weight ratio.
   - Pick items one by one until the knapsack is full, taking fractions if necessary.

By understanding and applying these principles, you can determine if a problem is suitable for a greedy approach and devise an appropriate greedy algorithm to solve it.
